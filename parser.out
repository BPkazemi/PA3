Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> expression PLUS expression
Rule 2     expression -> NUMBER

Terminals, with rules where they appear

MINUS                : 
NUMBER               : 2
PLUS                 : 1

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 1 1 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . expression
    (1) expression -> . expression PLUS expression
    (2) expression -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 2

    expression                     shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> expression .
    (1) expression -> expression . PLUS expression

    PLUS            shift and go to state 3


state 2

    (2) expression -> NUMBER .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 2 (expression -> NUMBER .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (expression -> NUMBER .)


state 3

    (1) expression -> expression PLUS . expression
    (1) expression -> . expression PLUS expression
    (2) expression -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 2

    expression                     shift and go to state 4

state 4

    (1) expression -> expression PLUS expression .
    (1) expression -> expression . PLUS expression

  ! shift/reduce conflict for PLUS resolved as shift
    $end            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> expression PLUS expression .)
    PLUS            shift and go to state 3

  ! PLUS            [ reduce using rule 1 (expression -> expression PLUS expression .) ]
